The focus of our senior design project is using AI agents to build data pipelines. 

Through my time in University of Cincinnati, I learnt about databases, SQL and Postgres in Database Theory Class ___,
In Natural Language Processing __ and Deep Learning __ classes, we learnt about Machine Learning and AI from it's fundamental concepts working up to learning how Large Language Models (LLMs) work. In Software Engineering __, we learnt about the software development lifecycle and best practices in building software and working in teams.
In the Artificial Intelligence class, we learnt about the history of AI, different AI techniques and algorithms.

In my past co-op, at Tembo Data Systems, I was responsible for all-things data. Working in a startup environment, I had to wear many hats and learn quickly. I got the chance to work on the end-to-end data pipeline, from data ingestion to transformation and storage and then finally BI and reporting. Having worked in this domain before, building data pipelines manually, and even fixing bugs in existing pipelines, I have a good understanding of the challenges involved, and I am even more excited to build a solution that can automate this process.

I am personally excited about this project because it combines my interests in artificial intelligence and data engineering. I enjoy working with data because it is what enables AI. Without the right data pipelines, AI models cannot be trained effectively. 

Because Data Engineering is such a vast field, we would want to start off with a specific use case, with only a handful of data sources and transformations. This would allow us to build a proof of concept that we can then expand upon. Also, working with our advisor, Bo Brunton,  who is the head of Product at Pantomath, a company that does data monitoring using AI, we can get real-world insights into the challenges faced by data engineers and how our solution can address them.

We hope to build a product and solution that we are proud of and something that has a real world use case. Also, my hope is that then I would be able to leverage this product to demonstrate my understanding of both AI and Data Engineering, and use it as a portfolio piece when applying for jobs in the future.

I think a subjective way for me to self-evaluate my contributions is how much I learn while building this project. Throughout my time working on this project, I hope to use my existing expertise in data engineering, but also learn more about AI and how to build AI agents and also deepen my understanding of data engineering.
