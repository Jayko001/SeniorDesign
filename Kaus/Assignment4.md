## User Stories for an AI Data Pipeline Agent

**1. The Data Engineer Perspective**
* As a data engineer, I want to describe data sources, transformations, and destinations using natural language prompts, so that I can automate the generation of boilerplate pipeline code and reduce my development time by more than 50%.

**2. The Data Analyst Perspective**
* As a data analyst, I want to independently create a data feed from a new source to my business intelligence (BI) tool without writing any code, so that I can get the data I need for my reports in hours instead of waiting weeks for engineering resources to become available.

**3. The Head of Data Perspective**
* As a head of data, I want to empower my non-technical stakeholders to fulfill their own data requests through a simple interface, so that I can clear our team's backlog of tasks and focus my expensive engineering talent on high-impact, strategic data architecture projects.

**4. The Data Scientist Perspective**
* As a data scientist, I want to rapidly build and modify pipelines to create experimental datasets for model training, so that I can accelerate my feature engineering and model iteration lifecycle, leading to faster deployment of more accurate predictive models.
