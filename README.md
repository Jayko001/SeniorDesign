## Team & Project Abstract

**Team:** Kaaustaaub Shankar, Dhiren Mahajan, Jay Kothari  
**Advisor:** Bo Brunton (Pantomath)  
**Abstract:** Datagrep is an AI assistant that converts natural-language analytics requests into end-to-end pipelines. It discovers sources, infers schemas, designs joins/filters, scaffolds tests and deployment, and tracks lineage so analysts get auditable, repeatable pipelines in minutes instead of weeks.

---

## Project Description (Assignment #2)

Datagrep helps non-technical stakeholders and data teams generate and maintain pipelines without hand-written boilerplate. It maps raw sources, infers schemas, builds joins and filters, produces deployable code, and enforces observability guardrails so pipelines are testable, scheduled, and auditable.

## User Stories and Design Diagrams (Assignment #4)

### User Stories

- [Shared/User_Stories.md](Shared/User_Stories.md) — perspectives from data engineer, data analyst, head of data, and data scientist.

### Design Diagrams: Level 0, Level 1, Level 2

- [Design_Diagrams/DesignDiagrams.pdf](Design_Diagrams/DesignDiagrams.pdf) (all diagrams)  
- Level 0: ![D0](Design_Diagrams/D0.png)  
- Level 1: ![D1](Design_Diagrams/D1.png)  
- Level 2: ![D2](Design_Diagrams/D2.png)

### Diagram Conventions & Purpose

- Legend: ![Legend](Design_Diagrams/legend.png)
- Detailed packet: [Shared/Assignment4.md](Shared/Assignment4.md) and [Design_Diagrams/DesignDiagrams.docx](Design_Diagrams/DesignDiagrams.docx)
- Each level progressively drills from user-facing request flow (L0) to subsystem interactions and data movement across ingestion, planning, execution, and monitoring (L1–L2).
