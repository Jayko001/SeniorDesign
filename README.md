## Team & Project Abstract

- **Team:** Kaus, Dhiren, Jay 
- **Advisor:** Bo Brunton 

**Project Abstract:**

Datagrep: an AI assistant that converts plain-English analyst requests into data pipelines (temporary or permanent), performing source mapping, joins, filters, schema inference, profiling, and lightweight guardrails (lineage, scheduling, quality). It reduces time-to-insight while keeping work auditable and repeatable.
